# Meme Generator App
This is a simple Meme Generator app built with React. The app allows users to generate random memes by fetching images from an external API and adding custom text on top and bottom of the image.

## Features
- Random Meme Generation: The app fetches a list of memes from an external API and randomly selects an image URL to generate a meme. This allows for a wide variety of memes to be generated.
- Customizable Text: Users can input their desired text for the top and bottom sections of the meme. This allows for personalized captions or messages to be added to the generated memes.
- Dynamic Image Display: The app dynamically displays the generated meme image along with the entered text. Users can see the meme in real-time as they input their text or generate a new meme.
- Fetching Memes from API: The app fetches meme images from the Imgflip API using the get_memes endpoint. This ensures a constant supply of fresh and up-to-date meme images for users to generate.
- User-friendly Interface: The app provides a simple and intuitive user interface. It includes input fields for text entry, a button to generate new memes, and the generated meme image with the added text.
- Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, allowing users to access and use it on various devices and screen sizes. It ensures a consistent and enjoyable experience across different platforms.
